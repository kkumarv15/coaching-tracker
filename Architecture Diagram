## Narrative (Stakeholder Review)

### 1) What this system is
Coaching Tracker is a **frontend-only web application** designed for coaches to manage client profiles (coachees), coaching sessions, referral sources, and practice analytics. It is intentionally lightweight: no backend server, no database server, and no runtime infrastructure beyond static web hosting.

### 2) How it works at runtime
When the user opens the app, the browser loads three core assets:
- `index.html` (UI structure)
- `styles.css` (layout and responsive styling)
- `app.js` (application logic)

The `CoachingTracker` class in `app.js` initializes the application, loads data from LocalStorage, optionally seeds demo data when empty, wires UI events, and controls screen state (login vs main app).

### 3) Data and state management
All business data is stored in **browser LocalStorage** under the keys:
- `coachees`
- `sessions`
- `sources`
- `currentUser`

This means data is private to the browser/device and persists across refreshes. CRUD operations update in-memory arrays first, then persist through a shared save mechanism.

### 4) Analytics and reporting
The analytics module computes practice KPIs (hours, sessions, clients, averages) and segmented views (payment type, weekday, year, demographics, source performance). Results are rendered as charts via **Chart.js** and as tabular summaries in the dashboard.

### 5) Deployment and web hosting
The app is hosted as a static site using GitHub:
- Source code in `main`
- GitHub Actions workflow publishes to `gh-pages`
- GitHub Pages serves public site over HTTPS

This gives a low-cost, low-maintenance hosting model suitable for demos and lightweight production scenarios.

### 6) Strengths and constraints
**Strengths**
- Fast delivery and simple operations
- Zero backend hosting complexity
- Easy to clone, run, and deploy

**Constraints**
- No multi-user/shared database
- No server-side security controls
- LocalStorage limitations (capacity, browser-specific data)

### 7) Recommended next evolution
For scale and enterprise readiness, next step is introducing a backend API + cloud database, replacing demo auth with secure identity, and adding backup/export controls.
